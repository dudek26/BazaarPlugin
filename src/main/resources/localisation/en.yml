# This plugin uses MiniMessage for formatting.
# Check https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/index.html for more info about formatting with MiniMessage.
# You can also use MiniMessage's web preview: https://webui.advntr.dev/
#
# Note, that GUI titles do NOT support MiniMessage formatting. Instead, you should use 'ยง' for formatting.
# This may be changed in the future.
